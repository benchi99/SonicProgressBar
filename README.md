# SonicProgressBar

A Sonic progress bar for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs.

This is the Sonic progress bar for [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) based on the Nyan Progress Bar by Dmitry Batkovitch. It displays Sonic running in the basic and indefinite progress bars.

It currently is a WIP.

### Code
